# Sentry

This extension allows you to add Sentry error logging to your Teletron environment. Any errors
that are caught on the node backend and the web frontend will be logged to sentry.

No widgets or components are available for this extension. Sentry is initialized once the DSN is configured.

## Configuration

Its configuration requires your Sentry DSN. You can retrieve it from your [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
project settings.

You can access your Teletron extension configuration by opening the _Extensions_ menu option in the CMS.
