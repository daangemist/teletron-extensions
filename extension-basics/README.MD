# Teletron Basics

Essential / basic components and widgets are provided by this extension.

This is the default installed extension in a new Teletron instance.

It provides an Iframe, image or text component, paired with 2 label widgets (one remote) and a page reload button.

## Query method

The remote label widget uses [json-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-query) for the query part
of the retrieved data. Read the package repository details for more information on how to query the data.
