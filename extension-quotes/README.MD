# Quotes extension

This extension allows you to display a quote on your Display. It selects a random quote out of a set and displays it.
It will display it for a period of time, after which it is replaced with a new one.

You can also choose to provide your own set of quotes.

Additionally you can choose to shorten the display time of the quote. It will then disappear and nothing will be visible
until the new quote is selected.
