## iCal calendars

Use the following tutorials to find the iCal URL for your calendar:

- [Google calendar](https://support.pushpay.com/s/article/How-do-I-get-an-iCal-feed-from-Google-Calendar)
- [Apple calendar](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-find-your-icloud-calendar-url/)
- [Office 365](https://support.pushpay.com/s/article/How-do-I-get-an-iCal-link-from-Office-365)

Once you have found the iCal URL for your calendar you can add it via the CMS. In the left bar there
will be a header called **calendars** with the option _calendars_ below it. Here you can manage your
calendars. Once a calendar is added, it can be select to be displayed as part of a widget or component.
